Objective:

Write a Linux device driver for controlling the blinking rate of an LED on your system. The device will expose a character device interface that allows the user to set the blink interval for the LED.
Requirements:

    Device Initialization and Cleanup:
        Create a device that can be opened, read, written to, and closed by the user-space program.
        When the driver is loaded, initialize an LED control (or simulate an LED blink if you don't have access to hardware).
        When the driver is removed, clean up and stop the blinking.

    Reading and Writing to the Device:
        Write: The user should be able to set the blink interval (in milliseconds) by writing to the device. If no input is given, print a warning message, and set the default blink interval to 1000ms.
        Read: The user can read the current blink interval. The kernel will send back the value as a string in milliseconds (e.g., "1000ms").
