Exercise 2: Simple Counter

Objective: Create a kernel module that increments a counter every second and prints the updated counter value to the kernel log each time it updates.

Requirements:

    Use init_module and cleanup_module functions.
    Use the msleep() function to delay for 1 second between each increment.
    Print the value of the counter to the kernel log with pr_info().
    Create a variable that can be set via the command line to change the counter increment value (e.g., an integer step).
    Create a Makefile to compile the module.
