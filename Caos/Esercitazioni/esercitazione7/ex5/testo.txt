Exercise 4: Simple Arithmetic in Kernel Space

Objective: Create a kernel module that performs simple arithmetic (e.g., addition, subtraction) on two integers provided via the command line.

Requirements:

    Use module_param() to define two integers as command-line parameters (num1 and num2).
    Perform a chosen arithmetic operation (addition or subtraction).
    Print the result to the kernel log when the module is loaded.
    Create a Makefile to compile the kernel module.
