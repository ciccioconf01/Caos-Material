Question 2

<Place an [X] for the correct answer>

Which of the following statements is TRUE about memory-mapped I/O?

[ ] The CPU requires special instructions to communicate with memory-mapped devices.
[ ] Memory-mapped I/O allows devices and regular memory to share the same address space.
[ ] Memory-mapped I/O eliminates the need for an address bus.
[ ] The primary advantage of memory-mapped I/O is that it provides higher transfer speeds than DMA.


Question 3
==========
Consider a filesystem based on i-nodes. Every data block on disk can store 512b. The i-node structure has two levels of hierarchy. The first-level inode contains ten 32-bit pointers to data blocks and ten 32-bit pointers to second-level i-nodes. Each second-level i-node contains 10 32-bit pointers to data blocks.

The system must store a 12 KB file on disk. Compute:
* The number of data blocks required on disk
* The number of first-level and second-level i-nodes required to index the data blocks
* The total occupation of the i-nodes in bytes
