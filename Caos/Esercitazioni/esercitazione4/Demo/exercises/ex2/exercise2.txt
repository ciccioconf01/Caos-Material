Exercise 2: Smart Watering System (Queue and Message Passing)
Scenario

A smart irrigation system manages the watering of plants based on soil moisture levels and time of day. The system consists of the following components:

    Soil Moisture Sensor
        Monitors the moisture level of the soil and sends data to a queue.
        Each reading includes the moisture level, time of reading, and sensor ID.

    Water Pump Controller
        Receives soil moisture data from the queue and controls the watering system.
        If the soil is too dry, it activates the water pump to water the plants.

    Weather Forecast System
        Monitors the weather forecast (e.g., predicts rain) and sends warnings to the watering system.
        If rain is predicted, the system prevents unnecessary watering.

    Logger System
        Logs the soil moisture readings, watering actions, and any weather-related alerts.

Requirements

    Soil Moisture Data Queue Use a FreeRTOS queue to simulate incoming soil moisture data. Ensure proper communication between the sensor, pump controller, and weather system.

    Message Passing Use message passing to allow communication between the weather forecast system and the watering system (e.g., prevent watering if rain is predicted).

    Synchronization Use synchronization mechanisms like semaphores to ensure tasks are properly coordinated. Ensure that the watering system does not operate while the weather system is still processing.

    Fault Handling Handle conditions where the moisture sensor detects extreme values (e.g., faulty sensors) or where the queue is full/empty.
