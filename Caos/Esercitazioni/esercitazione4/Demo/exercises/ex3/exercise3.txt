Exercise 3: Home Automation System (Queue and Message Passing)
Scenario

A home automation system controls lights, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), and security based on user commands, time of day, and environmental factors. The system consists of the following components:

    User Command Interface
        Receives user commands and sends them to a queue.
        Commands can include "turn on light", "set temperature", and "lock doors".

    HVAC Controller
        Receives temperature settings from the user and adjusts the home HVAC system to maintain the desired temperature.

    Lighting System
        Controls the lights based on time of day and user commands.
        The system turns off lights during the night or when the user requests it.

    Security System
        Monitors the house's security status and locks doors when triggered by the user or sensors.

    Logger System
        Logs actions performed by the home automation system, such as temperature changes, lights being turned on/off, and door locks.

Requirements

    Command Queue Use a FreeRTOS queue to simulate user input commands. Ensure that the lighting system, HVAC controller, and security system properly read commands from the queue.

    Message Passing Use message passing to enable communication between the components, like notifying the lighting system when the house is in "night mode" (all lights should be off).

    Synchronization Use semaphores or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure tasks like HVAC adjustments or lighting changes are done sequentially and do not interfere with each other.

    Fault Handling Handle edge cases like invalid commands (e.g., temperature settings outside of the allowable range) or system errors (e.g., security breach alerts).
