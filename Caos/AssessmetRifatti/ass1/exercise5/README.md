# Exercise 5 - Scheduling

Consider the following set of hard-realtime periodic tasks :

| Task | Period | WCE
|------|--------|-------
| P1   | 50     | 25
| P2   | 80     | 35

Compute if the scheduling is feasible using the EDF algorithm, explaining the conditions required to schedule the tasks and the show how the tasks will be scheduled using a timing diagram with at least two periods for each task.
