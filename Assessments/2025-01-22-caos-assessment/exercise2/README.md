# Exercise 2 - Scheduling


Analyze a set of real-time tasks and schedule them using both the **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** and **Rate Monotonic (RM)** scheduling algorithms. 

## Task Set

The system consists of 4 periodic tasks. The details of each task are as follows:

| Task | Period (ms) | Execution Time (ms) |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| T1   | 4           | 1                   |
| T2   | 6           | 2                   |
| T3   | 8           | 3                   |
| T4   | 12          | 4                   |

### Part 1: Feasibility analysis

Perform the feasibility analysis for EDF and RM. In the case of RM, just check the sufficient condition.


### Part 2: Scheduling

If the schedulability analysis is positive, draw a giant chart of the two scheduling algorithms for the two tasks in the first 24ms.
